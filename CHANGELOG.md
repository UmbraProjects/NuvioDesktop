# Changelog

## 1.0.2 - 2026-06-19

### Added

- Added full-screen in-app trailer playback on desktop. Trailer playback no longer affects Continue Watching, watch progress, next-episode autoplay, or Trakt scrobbling.
- Added desktop HDR handling modes: display-aware Auto, forced SDR Tonemap, and source-metadata Passthrough.
- Added Neutral, Cinematic, and Vivid desktop color profiles. Profiles can also be cycled during playback with `F9`; `F8` cycles HDR modes.
- Added an on-screen indicator when changing HDR or color presets with a keyboard shortcut.
- Added subtitle font selection and persistence. Desktop users can select from their installed system fonts directly in the native player subtitle controls.
- Added custom Library poster-service templates for services such as PostersPlus, RPDB, and self-hosted alternatives. Templates support `{imdb_id}`, `{tmdb_id}`, and `{type}` placeholders.
- Added persistent rotating desktop diagnostic logs under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Nuvio\logs`. The active log is `nuvio.log`, with three rotated backups retained.
- Added update checks and downloads for this fork's Windows portable ZIP releases. Downloaded archives are revealed in Explorer with safe manual replacement instructions.

### Improved

- Improved Windows video rendering with updated HDR tone mapping, gamut mapping, scaling, dithering, and debanding configuration.
- Improved accelerated playback reliability by scaling the streaming cache and readahead window with playback speed.
- Improved YouTube trailer extraction by preferring unthrottled streams, targeting high-quality 1080p video, and avoiding unnecessarily expensive high-frame-rate streams.
- Added native support for separate video and audio URLs in the Windows player, improving adaptive YouTube stream playback.
- Improved seek behavior near the end of a video to avoid invalid end-of-file seeks.
- Subtitle style and video profile changes now redraw immediately while playback is paused.
- Improved series metadata resolution by retaining useful trailers and links from supplemental add-ons while continuing to search for complete episode metadata.
- Improved TV-mode details navigation, including season selection, row transitions, focus reset, and scroll positioning.
- Improved keyboard, wheel, and drag navigation for the cast row on details pages.
- Improved hero responsiveness by prioritizing the currently displayed item while retaining background metadata prefetching with bounded concurrency.

### Fixed

- Fixed heroes appearing completely blank when a banner or logo URL is unavailable. Failed banners now fall back to posters, and failed logos fall back to the title.
- Fixed excessive simultaneous hero metadata requests that could delay artwork on a cold start.
- Added diagnostic entries for failed hero banners, posters, and logos, with URL query strings removed from logs.
- Fixed IntroDB integration to use its current `/intro` endpoint and response format.
- Fixed desktop trailer playback being constrained to the small embedded popup.
- Fixed some separate YouTube audio/video streams stalling or playing without audio in the Windows native player.
- Fixed saved subtitle appearance and delay settings being dropped during player startup or subtitle-track loading.
- Fixed desktop Trakt authentication leaking across local profiles; existing primary-profile authentication is migrated automatically.
- Fixed subtitle add-ons that declare singular `subtitle` resources or use `tv` instead of `series` aliases.
